# My personal website (mastershinjin.github.io)

Personal website I built in the style of retro windows 98, showcasing some personal projects, about me, etc.... Mainly built utilizing pre-existing + my own CSS/HTML code with some added vanilla JS. I may invest into utilizing more modern frameworks later on, but for my own sanity constraining it just to HTML + CSS + JS for now. Good for practicing web development skills and also general programming.
